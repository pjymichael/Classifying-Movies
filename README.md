# Classifying-Movies
Project 2 from Data8, a module i took during my summer at UC Berkeley. Create your own feature set to classify movies based on their scripts. P.S. Got an A+ for that mod

Edit the feature set and evaluate your model! Utilised K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm for the classification.
